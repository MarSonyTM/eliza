# Current Status and Development Roadmap

## What Works Now:

1. ✅ Binance Service

    - Real-time price updates via WebSocket
    - Stable connection and low latency
    - Price precision to 2 decimal places

2. ✅ CoinGecko Service

    - Comprehensive market data
    - Rate limiting and caching
    - Price validation
    - 24h volume and price changes

3. ✅ Basic Testing Framework
    - Automated tests for both services
    - Error handling and validation
    - Clear test output and stages

## To-Do List (Priority Order):

1. 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**:

    - Implement arbitrage detection between Binance and CoinGecko
    - Add price alerts for significant movements
    - Create a basic trading strategy using the real-time data

2. 🔄 **Trading Strategy Development**:

    - Add more trading pairs (ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT)
    - Implement position sizing and risk management
    - Create backtesting functionality

3. 🛠️ **Technical Improvements**:

    - Add logging system for all trades and alerts
    - Implement error recovery for WebSocket disconnections
    - Add database storage for historical data

4. 📊 **Analysis & Monitoring**:

    - Create a dashboard for real-time monitoring
    - Add performance metrics and statistics
    - Implement automated reporting

5. 🔒 **Security & Stability**:
    - Add API key management
    - Implement circuit breakers
    - Add system health monitoring

## Next Focus:

The recommended next step is to implement arbitrage detection since we already have two reliable price sources (Binance and CoinGecko). This will allow us to:

1. Compare prices in real-time
2. Identify profitable trading opportunities
3. Test our price data reliability
4. Build the foundation for automated trading strategies
